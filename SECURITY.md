## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Real-Time Launchpad seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not file public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, report security vulnerabilities privately by:

1. **Email**: Contact the maintainer directly at: [put email here]
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's [Security Advisory](https://github.com/RichLewis007/React-19-Real-Time-Launchpad/security/advisories/new) feature

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of affected source files
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept exploit code (if possible)
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: As soon as possible, depending on severity

### Vulnerability Severity

We use the following severity classifications:

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data disclosure
- **High**: SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, CSRF, insecure dependencies
- **Low**: Minor security weaknesses, best practice violations

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Users

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- Regularly review access logs and security monitoring
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts

## Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

- **Server Actions**: Type-safe server-side operations
- **Input Validation**: Automatic validation on all user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in protection against cross-site request forgery
- **Security Headers**: Configured via `proxy.ts` for enhanced security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates to address known vulnerabilities

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the issue and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to identify any potential similar problems
3. Prepare a fix and test it thoroughly
4. Issue a security advisory and release the fix
5. Credit the reporter (if desired)

We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days and communicate progress regularly.

## Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly report vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in release notes (if desired)
- Listed in our SECURITY.md contributors section
- Subject to our appreciation and thanks
